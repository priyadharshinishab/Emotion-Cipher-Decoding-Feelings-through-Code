# Emotion-Cipher-Decoding-Feelings-through-Code
A hackathon-ready project combining AI + NLP + Encryption Logic to protect user privacy while retaining emotional context. Where words stay secret, but feelings remain understood.

Overview :
 is an innovative AI project that blends Emotion Recognition and Cybersecurity Encryption.  
It detects emotions from text input using Hugging Face Transformer modelsand then encrypts the detected emotion using AES-GCM and RSA encryption for secure transmission or storage.

This project was developed as part of the Emotion Cipher Hackathon Challenge, blending empathy, AI, and secure communication.
